* **Medium: Open for discussion**
* **Design Budget: 10k**
* **Print Budget: TBD**
* **Contract Structure: Because of the limited budget, we would look to xxix to set the graphic structure, and the SoA staff will populate the assets. During that process, there would most likely be a redline needed from xxix to ensure quality control prior to print.**
